Weather Prediction

This Machine Learning project aims to predict the weather report of a particular region using Deep Neural Networks and Regression techniques. The project leverages libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn to preprocess data, build, train, and evaluate models.

Overview :
Weather prediction is a critical task with numerous applications, including agriculture, disaster management, and daily life planning. Accurate weather forecasting can help in preparing for adverse weather conditions, optimizing resource usage, and enhancing safety. This project focuses on predicting future weather parameters like maximum temperature and precipitation based on present parameters.

Project Features :
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization using Pandas and Numpy.

Model Building: Constructing deep neural network models using TensorFlow for weather prediction.

Model Training: Training the models with appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics and visualizations.

Prediction: Making future weather predictions based on the trained models.

Libraries and Tools Used
Numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

TensorFlow: For building and training deep neural networks.

Scikit-learn: For regression techniques, model evaluation, and additional preprocessing.


Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing historical weather data, including features such as:
Maximum Temperature,
Minimum Temperature,
Precipitation,
Average Temperature,
And other relevant meteorological parameters,


Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Using Pandas to read and load the dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Implementing strategies to fill or remove missing data.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing data to ensure efficient training.
Data Splitting: Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets.


Model Building
The project uses TensorFlow to build deep neural network models. The architecture includes multiple layers with appropriate activation functions to capture the complex patterns in the weather data.
